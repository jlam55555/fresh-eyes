Harnessing powerful pattern-recognition from fellow human beings

**NOTE**: This is a THEORY IN PROGRESS. Ideas are flowing now. Implementation will come later. To suggest an implementation, email me.

### Inspiration
A general chronology of the founding of this project:

1. Dr. Katherine Nuzzo always says to be metacognitive of one's mistakes.
2. Jonathan Lam writes down his errors in vain to attempt to solve his common mistakes.
3. Jonathan Lam looks at his mistakes but sees nothing. Jonathan Lam gets more frustrated.
4. Jonathan Lam wonders: what if Jonathan Lam can get other people to see mistakes for him?
5. Jonathan Lam creates GitHub repository fresh-eyes.

In a world full of busy minds and lack of creativity, sometimes a fresh mind can be the best way to approach a problem. Whether it is a simple math problem that the mind cannot wrap itself around or the built-up frustration fruitless scholastic effort, tunnel vision from preconceptions can easily obscure the answer. Most often the answer comes from synthesis, some extraordinary meaning from the ordinary.

This is what fresh-eyes will aspire to create. No two people think the same; likewise, a person will likely not have the same mental obstacles as another. The task of answering problems without inspiration, from a personal to a universal scale, would be greatly helped through the use of collaboration. Human minds, being better at abstract pattern recognition than any computer system, would be the best problem-solvers for this project.

Another potential application of this project is the analysis of the pattern-analysis of users for the advancement of pattern-recognition in computers. This would be very complex, however, and any research would likely be carried out by third-party analytical technology companies.
